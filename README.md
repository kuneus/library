ðŸ”— Live preview link: https://kuneus.github.io/library/

This is the Library project as part of The Odin Project curriculum!

## About the App

This is a virtual library where users can add books they want to read, are currently reading, or have completed reading. Users also have the option of deleting a book from the shelf or editing the status of the book. Additional features include a dark and light mode with respective library backgrounds and collapsible book sections.Currently, the page is partially responsive for different browser sizes but is not yet fully responsive for mobile viewing. Also featured is a set of some of my favorite books ðŸ™‚

## Project Objective

The focus of this project was to apply knowledge of object constructors for creating new book objects with each submission. Each book object is then pushed to a simple array, where it is then looped through a function to create each book card. This project was made with Javascript ES6, HTML5, and CSS3.
